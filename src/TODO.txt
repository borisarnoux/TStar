* Be sure the garbage collection of fat pointers is done.
* Make sure the frames for writing consistently increase and decrease the use counter.
* We are checking relationships of tdecs with arguments, but not with created frames.
* When the RESP_TRANSFER occur, do the incrementations of use count in the triggered closures.

* IMPORTANT : Resp transfer & deadlock...

* At least two problems with invalidation set :
   * it is not updated properly.
   * the closures in do_invalidate are not correct.

* Problem with state checks on data arrival ( suppress them ?)
